#  UTM-Linux-WIP-Unusable!
this is a fork will try to port utm qemu manger to linux x86_64(amd64) and aarch64(arm64)
this is not USABLE YET

why to linux?

for people want to use qemu easy as usaing vitrualbox and vitrualbox can't do tcg vm (arm system on x86_64 machine, x86 system on arm machine...)
plain qemu is too hard to use
