#  UTM-Linux-WIP-Unusable!
this is a fork will try to port utm qemu manger to linux x86_64(amd64) and aarch64(arm64)
this is not USABLE YET

why to linux?

for people want to use qemu easy as usaing vitrualbox and vitrualbox can't do tcg vm (arm system on x86_64 machine, x86 system on arm machine...)
plain qemu is too hard to use

aarch64/arm64 linux on debian/ubuntu is first target to support
and should not run in snapcraft or sandbox (specially on jetson with jetpack 5.0)
# THIS PAGE IS WORK IN PORGESS
